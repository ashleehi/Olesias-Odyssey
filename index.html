    <p class="crosshair">Stranded on a boat for over a month, Olessia finds herself surrounded by the deceased and completely out of food.
        For reference, her village was overcome by a terrible plague and almost everyone planned an escape. Olessia and
        10 other people from her village sailed across the Sea of Selecia. Halfway through the sea, the sails tore
        leaving the boat to float wanderlessly. Over the span of two weeks half of the crew had passed and food was
        becoming scarce. Another two weeks had passed and Olessia was the only survivor. She had no food left whatsoever
        and was feeling extremely weak and pale. Her stomach aching from the lack of food and hydration, Olessia decided
        it was time to accept her fate when the boat came to a
        rumble and a stop. Olessia found herself washed up on the shore of an island. </p>
